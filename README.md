## Hi there 👋

My name is Giovanni and I am a quantum science and technology master student at [TUM](https://academics.nat.tum.de/start) and [LMU](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html) researching about tensor networks and topology in condensed matter physics in the [QMQI group](https://www.ph.nat.tum.de/cmt/about-us/).

## About me 🤙
### Academic work ⚛
- I am currently working on my Master thesis, where I analyze Floquet topological non-equilibrium phases in a Driven Kitaev Honeycomb Model. Most of my work is found in my [Master Thesis repository](https://github.com/gconcheri/MasterThesis)
- I also recently did a student research job on tensor networks algorithm known as: Tensor Cross Interpolation and Chebyshev Interpolation, with the aim to use them to improve simulations of correlation functions on quantum computers! Here you can find the [repository](https://github.com/gconcheri/Student-Research-Job)

### Hobbies:
- I play the guitar and the piano. I really love music in general! 🎸
- I enjoy doing lots of sport: running, gym, swimming and recently I've been trying breakdance
- I love spending quality time with my friends and my family! And of course, cooking 👨🏻‍🍳
- I also enjoy hiking, reading and watching TV
... actually there are many things I like ahaha

Ciao 🪐
